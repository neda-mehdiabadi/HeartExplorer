## üìñ Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of **single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq)** data to define the **fetal gene program** in **dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)** at **single-cell resolution**. It supports the findings of the manuscript:

## üìä Dataset Summary
| Group         | Age Range       | Samples (n) | Nuclei Count |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Fetal         | 19‚Äì20 weeks      | 3           | 27,136        |
| Non-Diseased  | 4‚Äì14 years       | 3           | 16,445        |
| DCM           | 5‚Äì10 years     | 4           | 31,593        |

- All samples are derived from the **left ventricle**.
- This is a large single nuclei RNA-seq dataset from the Heart Regeneration group at Murdoch Children's Research Institute. 
 
## üîç Key Analyses
-  **Cell Type Identification**  
  Annotate and cluster cell types within each group using unsupervised methods.
-  **Cell Composition Analysis**  
  Compare shifts in cell-type abundance across healthy, fetal, and DCM states.
-  **Pathway and Transcriptional Analysis**  
  Discover regulatory changes and transcription factor activity in DCM.
-  **Fetal Gene Program Recovery in DCM**  
  Identify gene expression signatures indicative of fetal-like reprogramming in disease.

## üåê Explore the Data
I have built an **interactive web portal** that permits interrogation of our dataset and, hence, increases the dataset‚Äôs accessibility and utility. To check our website, please visit [www.HeartExplorer.org](http://www.HeartExplorer.org/).
- Search by cell type or gene name
- View gene expression across conditions
- Perform pathway enrichment analysis across conditions
- Download selected data tables
